# Professionalism Guide

## What Is Professionalism?

Here at the MSRP staff team, we aim to maintain a good public image of the staff team not only with members within the server but also with people outside of it. To do this, we really try to emphasize the importance of Professionalism. Professionalism in moderation simply means the practice of moderation by conducting yourself in a formal, polite and reasonable manner. Below are all aspects of professionalism we expect you to take into account as a member of the MSRP Staff team.

***

## In-Game Professionalism

* Ensure your avatar looks formal and uses the correct staff uniform. Avoid excessive accessories or accessories that resemble those of an LEO officer.
* Make sure all nicknames are set up appropriately (e.g., Madison State Staff).
* Use good SPaG (Spelling, Punctuation & Grammar) when interacting with people in-game. This avoids giving the impression that inexperienced or immature users are staff members.
  * If you make a mistake, correct yourself by retyping the message with an asterisk (\*) at the start to show it's the corrected message.
* Introduce yourself when you teleport to a member. A simple formal greeting like "Hi, how can I help?" is fine.
* Avoid informal abbreviations (e.g., "u" instead of "you" or "wdym" instead of "what do you mean?"). It may take longer to type, but it's much more professional.
* Remember you are not roleplaying when on as Active Staff. Do not interrupt roleplays.
  * Drive carefully at all times.
  * Yield to emergency vehicles and civilian vehicles when necessary.
  * Avoid pulling people over with your car; use the MDT to track down the member.
  * Avoid parking in "illegal" or busy areas.
* Use in-game tools to work efficiently.
* When in a Mod Scene:
  * Make sure your game character is with the person you are moderating.
  * Avoid cuffing anyone. If they attempt to run, kick them for staff evasion.
  * Avoid using tools such as a taser or beanbag shotgun unless explicitly required by procedure.

## Discord Professionalism

### Discord Chats

* Be courteous in public chats. Talk freely but do not cross boundaries.
* If conversations shift toward an argument, attempt to steer them back on course by changing the topic or lightening the mood.
* If drama or arguments break out, ask involved parties to stop arguing and to "take it to their DMs". If it doesn't cease, escalate to a Discord Moderator.
* Avoid spamming in public channels. Staff may ping SHR when necessary, but avoid doing so in public channels when not conversing with them.
* We do not typically moderate DMs. However, if a case is severe enough, action may be taken. Members typically cannot be moderated for DM messages—report and block them when appropriate.

### Public Voice Channels (VCs)

* In public VCs (e.g., lounges), remain respectful. Avoid slandering people and crossing the line between joking and disrespect.
* When screensharing, be careful:
  * Prefer to screenshare only the tab you wish to show rather than your entire screen.
  * If you screenshare Discord, ensure you are not revealing staff channels.

### Private Voice Channels

* Staff-only VC's are for staff only. Do not bring anyone outside the staff team into these VCs.
* All discussions within staff offices are confidential, especially in the IA office.

### Moderation Voice Channels (Moderation VC)

* When asking a person to join a Moderation VC, remain respectful and avoid abbreviations. A polite request example:
  * "Join Mod Scene 1 VC please"
* Avoid abrupt commands like "Mod Scene 1 VC Now" or "MS2 VC". Being polite helps create a respectful tone at the start.
* In the Mod Scene VC, be commanding but not disrespectful.
  * If participants enter shouting, ask them to calm down and explain you will speak with them shortly.
  * Do not tell people to "shut up". If they fail to listen, use Discord moderator tools.
* Get all sides of the story. Avoid arguments; if someone disagrees, plainly state the rule and where to find it.
* After drawing appropriate conclusions, explain the final verdict and any actions you will or will not be taking.
* If a person has a problem with your actions, give them your name and rank and tell them to open an Internal Affairs Ticket to report you.
  * If they refuse to leave, you may disconnect them. There is no need to defend or argue; they can open an IA ticket.
* Staff members should never engage in arguments, scream at, berate, or disrespect members. If you feel close to losing your temper:
  * Call another staff member to help, or
  * When finished with the scene, take a break.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you make a mistake: do not be defensive or blame others. Apologize, do what you can to rectify the issue, and inform the member they may open an IA ticket if they wish. Apologies can go a long way toward de-escalation.
