# Rank Guide

## Director Team (Senior High Ranks / SHR's)

The Director Team consists of three ranks:

* Director — marcus09lover (Operations Director)
* Deputy Director — iiExtractLaw (Department Coordinator)
* Assistant Director — MCCY00 & Dewsrath (Staff Management)

This team is responsible for the oversight of all aspects of MSRP. Avoid directly pinging or DMing these individuals unless they are needed.

## Internal Affairs Team

The Internal Affairs (IA) Team is the highest staff rank before Directorate and is made up of the most trusted and talented staff members. They are responsible for overseeing and supporting the Staff Team, as well as handling community-related matters when needed. Duties include:

* Conducting activity checks
* Handling reports
* Assessing members of the Staff Team
* Assisting staff with any issues they may face
* Acting as a first point of contact for confidential issues or when lower ranks cannot assist

All private conversations with Internal Affairs members are confidential and should not be discussed with other people.
{% endhint %}

## Administration Team

The Administration Team consists of 2 ranks:

* Administrator
* Senior Administrator

This team is made up of experienced staff members who work to keep in-game & Discord operations running smoothly. They are role models and leaders to those below them and are responsible for the final ridealongs to fully certify Trial Moderators. These are the best people to go to if you have any questions.

## Moderation Team

The Moderation Team consists of 4 ranks:

* Trainee Moderator
* Trial Moderator
* Moderator
* Senior Moderator

The Moderation Team is the backbone of the MSRP Staff Team. They are responsible for the upkeep of the in-game server and ensuring all in-game operations run smoothly.

* Trial Moderators are staff members who have just passed the exam phase and are completing their ridealongs to become fully certified. They will have full moderational capacity once they have passed their first ridealong.
* Trainee Moderators are official staff members who have passed the application stage and entered the training process. They must review the Staff Hub, complete the exam, and finish two ridealongs (with a 2-day gap between them). Trainee Moderators cannot moderate or act on behalf of the staff team during this phase but are still expected to follow all relevant staff policies. Once they’ve completed training and proven themselves, Internal Affairs may promote them to Moderator at any time.

## How Do I Get Promoted?

Internal Affairs evaluate promotion candidates across several areas. The main factors they look for are outlined below.

### Activity

Consistent activity is important. Meet the minimum requirements for time spent on shift. The more time you spend on Active Staff Duty, the more likely you are to be considered for promotion.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Moderations

IA will review your moderations relative to your time on shift — both quantity and quality matter. They look at:

* The number of moderations you issue
* The detail and clarity of your logs
* The reasoning you provide for each moderation
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Overall Ability as a Staff Member

IA assess your professionalism, efficiency, mannerisms, and history within the staff team. They look for leadership and role-model qualities. As you progress (especially from Senior Moderator onward), you’ll be expected to train Trial Moderators and demonstrate readiness for that responsibility.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

These are some of the factors considered. Keep in mind a rank is a privilege, not a right. Promotions are not guaranteed. Staff of the Week is awarded to those showing exceptional effort and activity during the week.

## How Long Does It Take?

There is no set amount of time required at a rank before promotion consideration. Typically, candidates are at a rank for 1–2 months before being considered, but timelines vary depending on the factors described above.
