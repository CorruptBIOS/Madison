# Discord Moderation

Rules & Policies

To make sure that everyone is safe within the community and that no staff are abusing their commands, we have a few policies and procedures that you must abide by. Please also note that the Internal Affairs Team has a log of all commands that are used and any abuse will be picked up and dealt with immediately.

Below is a list of the policies and regulations for Discord Moderation:

* No using commands that are not listed in this document.
* No giving roles that you're not permitted to give.
* No unauthorized banning, kicking, muting, or warning of people.
* No leaking Discord Moderation policies to non-members of the Staff Team. (Modlogs are private; they can only be shown to the person they belong to.)
* No warning PRC officials, Partnered Representatives or VIPs.
* You must use grammar in all punishments; this means capital letters and full stops.
* You're to only put things that relate to the punishment on there. For example, you shouldn't be banning someone for NSFW and then adding backup comments such as "Disrespectful" or "come back when you learn the rules".
* We don't moderate DMs. If anybody has an issue in DMs, instruct them to block the user and report it to Discord. Same applies for things that happen in other servers.

## When To Warn, Mute, Kick, Temp Ban, Ban

### When to warn

Warnings are a reminder to give to members for them to follow the server rules when they have not intended to break them. Below are a few examples of when to give someone a warning:

* Breaking Rule 7 - Misusing channels for their intended purposes (e.g., bot commands in general chat).
* Breaking Rule 2 - Not having their Roblox username or having an invalid callsign or symbol.
* Breaking Rule 1 - Pinging HRs+, PRC Officials, or VIPs.
* Breaking Rule 10 - Refusal to speak English (one or two words is fine; full conversations are not permitted).

When you're warning someone follow the format below:

{% code title="Warn command" %}
```
!warn [USER ID] [REASON]
```
{% endcode %}

Example:

```
!warn 1111181789340368898 - Rule 7 - Bot Commands in General Chat.
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### When to mute

The mute command is to be used when a member is causing an issue within the community. Before giving out mutes you should ask them to stop; if, after this verbal reminder, they continue, you should mute them.

Typical durations:

* Usually mutes are 2 hours.
* You are not permitted to mute anyone for more than 6 hours and no less than 20 minutes.

Examples of when to mute:

* Instigating issues within general chat (after being asked to stop).
* Spamming (minor spam; copying & pasting the same text over and over after being asked to stop).
* Causing drama (after being asked to stop).
* Refusal to leave Mod Scene VCs.

When you're muting someone follow the format below:

{% code title="Mute command" %}
```
!mute [USER ID] [DURATION] [REASON]
```
{% endcode %}

Example:

```
!mute 1111181789340368898 2h Rule 3 - Instigating Drama after being asked to stop.
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### When to kick

Kicks are given to people that are carrying on after mutes or fail to comply with Staff and/or Moderation action.

Examples of when to kick:

* If they carry on after being muted (carrying on with the same thing they were muted for, on the same day — you would not kick them a week later).
* Failing to comply with Rule 2 after being warned multiple times.

When you're kicking someone follow the format below:

{% code title="Kick command" %}
```
!kick [USER/ID] [REASON]
```
{% endcode %}

Example:

```
!kick 1111181789340368898 Carrying on drama after being muted.
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### When to temporary ban

Temp bans are for removing someone from the community for a period of time. Most temp bans are 7 days long; you may choose a range of 4 to 10 days. Any temp ban longer than 10 days or shorter than 4 days may result in consequences.

When you're temp banning someone follow the format below:

{% code title="Temp ban command" %}
```
!ban [USER/ID] [LENGTH] [REASON]
```
{% endcode %}

Example:

```
!ban 467387236963450883 7d Carrying on drama after being kicked.
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### When to permanent ban

When banning someone you're not to put "No Appeal" or "Not welcome here" in your reason; doing so will result in consequences. The bot has automation that may prevent appeals based on certain ban reasons.

Examples of reasons to ban:

* Mass pinging (4 or more different people in a minute; must be clearly trying to raid).
* Mass spamming (purposely spamming the chat to cause issues).
* Raiding.
* Extreme NSFW (sending pornographic images, gifs, etc.). This excludes joke references such as "Such a cock" or "I'll shag you" when clearly joking and not making someone feel uncomfortable.
* Advertising (only in the server).
* Racial slurs.

When you're banning someone follow the format below:

{% code title="Ban command" %}
```
!ban [USER/ID] [REASON]
```
{% endcode %}

Example:

```
!ban 467387236963450883 Mass Spamming.
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Permitted Commands

Below is a list of commands that you're able to use as a Discord Moderator. Using any other commands that are not on this list will result in consequences from the Management Team.

* !warn
* !mute
* !kick
* !ban
