# Tickets Guide

Here at Madison State Roleplay, we offer a ticketing system which contains a variety of categories:

* Community Support: Used for general questions and concerns, managed by Discord Moderators.
* Department Support: Used for department related questions, managed by Department High Command.
* Internal Affairs Support: Used for IA related questions and staff reports, managed by IA.

## Handling Tickets

The Community Support category is managed by Discord Moderators and is only given to those who apply. Below are guidelines to ensure staff follow correct standards of professionalism when managing tickets.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Begin with an introduction

Introduce yourself by giving your Roblox username or rank. To make things quicker, you can use the `!intro` command which provides an introduction.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Identify the user's request

Scroll to the top of the ticket to see what the user wishes to discuss.

* If it's clear what information they want, reply with everything they need.
* If it's not clear, politely request clarification.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Close the interaction properly

Once the person has been assisted, ask if there is anything else they need help with.

* If they say there isn't, you may close the ticket.
* If there is something else, assist them and then repeat the closing statement.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If a person is inactive for a long period of time, type `!inactive` and an auto-generated response will tell them further inactivity will result in the ticket being closed. If the inactivity threshold is met, you may close the ticket.
{% endhint %}

## Procedures of Professionalism

* Staff members must use perfect grammar at all times when interacting in tickets. If a mistake is made, immediately rectify it by editing your message.
* Staff members must be patient and attentive while handling tickets. No matter how trivial a question may seem, respond appropriately.
* Staff members must provide correct information. Members can and will quote what you say — misinformation can have serious consequences. If you are unsure about something, inform the member that you will need to consult other staff members to verify information and that you will return in a few moments. Speak to colleagues for assistance when needed.
* If you claim a ticket, you must complete it. If you suddenly need to go inactive and can no longer complete the ticket, inform the member you are no longer available to handle the ticket and will be un-claiming it so another staff member may take over. If possible, get another staff member to take over the ticket.
* If a ticket asks something beyond your expertise, inform the member you will pass the ticket to a higher-up, un-claim the ticket, and notify a higher-up staff member to handle it.
* Any issues that clearly require Internal Affairs or higher attention: inform the staff member they must wait, then ping the appropriate role/person.

## Common Questions

<details>

<summary>Why was I kicked or banned?</summary>

Explain why and when they were punished. Do not send a screenshot of our staff system showing the reason. Instead, guide them to the "View moderations" button (found in the information channel). If a person asks to view another person's moderation logs, tell them moderation logs are confidential (Department High Command is the only exception if they are investigating the member in their department).

<details>

<summary>How do I partner?</summary>

If someone asks how to partner, run the `!partner` command. If they don't meet the requirements, direct them to our store.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if a member is trolling via the ticket system?</summary>

If a member is trolling via the ticket system, feel free to Discord-moderate them and inform a member of Internal Affairs to remove their ticket access.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I request a higher-up for any reason?</summary>

If a person requests a higher-up for no valid reason, you are not required to provide one. The only situation where you must provide a higher-up is if you do not have the necessary expertise to deal with the ticket. If any person wishes to open a report, they must be directed to open an IA ticket.
