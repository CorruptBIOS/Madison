{% hint style="info" %}
Custom server messages and hints are permitted to be used by Administrator+. To request permission, post the message you wish to post in the following format:

`:m [NOTICE] (Custom message)`

Once permission is granted you may use the command. If you wish to post another custom message later, you must request permission again even if it is the same command.
