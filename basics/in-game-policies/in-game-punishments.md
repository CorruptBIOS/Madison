<summary>Verbal Warnings</summary>

A verbal warning is simply a moderator expressing to the member that they shouldn't do something or they need to change something. These can be given at a moderator's discretion in cases where a formal warning may not be necessary. For example, if a person is using restricted items or driving unrealistically, you can verbally warn them first to "fix up" instead of logging a warning.

Verbal warnings are not logged anywhere except your own notes/memory. While you may give these out at your discretion, please make sure not to be too lenient. In cases where a warning is needed, you should issue it.

<summary>Suicide Roleplay</summary>

Suicide Roleplay is roleplay that breaks PRC & Roblox TOS. There are requirements for something to be considered suicide roleplay. Simply seeing someone jump off a building may not be suicide roleplay, especially if they are roleplaying that they were pushed off or it was an accident.

It is only suicide RP if the member actively states they are going to commit self-harm or suicide (in-character). Examples include saying: "I am going to jump", or "Do anything and I will kill myself". Any comments that show they will commit suicide in roleplay are sufficient to classify this as suicide roleplay.

<details>

<summary>No Intention to Roleplay (NITRP)</summary>

No Intention To Roleplay (NITRP) covers a spectrum of behavior. Minor cases can warrant a simple warning (for instance, not roleplaying a simple action) up to a ban for trollers who have no intention to roleplay and only want to cause problems.

Issue NITRP at your discretion, but your moderation log must specify in detail the reason for the punishment.

<details>

<summary>Leaving To Avoid Punishment (LTAP)</summary>

Leaving to Avoid Punishment (LTAP) occurs when a member breaks rules and leaves the in-game server before you can issue an in-game punishment. If a member does this, you typically need to issue a Ban BOLO unless you are an administrator and can ban them yourself.

Ban BOLOs should include details — for LTAP, the reason shouldn't just say "LTAP"; it should also mention what rule they were originally being moderated for.

* If dealing with a person not in VC who then leaves, do not issue Ban BOLOs against them unless they have already broken rules that warrant a kick or worse.
