# STS Guide

## STS Rules

* No walking around during the STS, you must remain in formation at all times.
* No disturbing the STS, either via in-game chat or in the STS VC. If you have background noise, or any other issues, please make them known before the STS.
* Hold a professional standard at all times.
* You're only to stand in formation if you're on-duty staff; if you're roleplaying stand on the white line.
* You must be following the uniform policy at all times.
* You must park your car in the Civilian parking lots, and you should not be blocking the road with any form of police tape, barriers, vehicles, etc.
* The STS formation must be tight together and parallel to the white line.
* You must stand in the position that corresponds with your role.
* If you see a staff member not following any of these rules, then please gather proof and make a Staff Report.

## Getting Approval

To prevent STSs running constantly throughout the SSU there is a procedure to request and obtain approval. To get an STS approved you must ping an Administrative Member asking them for permission. Failure to obtain approval and conducting the STS will result in consequences.

Before requesting permission to host an STS, check for the following:

* Numerous Mod Calls
* Many punishments being given
* Not many people in the VC's

## Getting Started

Once approval has been granted from an Internal Affairs member or above to conduct an STS, follow these steps.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Gather staff and assign Host

* Get all On-Duty Staff into the On Duty Staff VC.
* The highest rank online will take the role of Host. If there are numerous people of the same rank, then decide amongst yourselves.
* The Host should designate:
  * Who will be doing VC & Avatar Check
  * Who is monitoring Crowd Control
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Announcements & prepare staff to join STS VC

Host should run the following in sequence. All Staff should make their way to the STS VC.

* Announce the following:

```
:m We will be conducting an STS shortly, start to finish off Roleplays.
```

* Wait 30 seconds
* Announce the following:

```
:m You will now all be teleported. Make sure to have no weapons equipped.
```

* Wait 5 seconds
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Bot commands

Run these commands in order:

```
:pt 900
:load others
:bring others
:bring others
```

Then announce:

```
:m Join STS VC and stand on the white line, communications code: MadiRP
:m Do not equip items, talk with in-game chat or via Roblox VC. Do not move/emote. Doing so will result in an immediate kick.
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Formation, checks and tasks

{% hint style="info" %}
Enforcement guidance:

* A tiny movement or accidentally equipping an item (unless it's a gun) should not result in a kick. Only major or repeated movements/disruptions should be kicked.
* Anyone talking via Roblox VC, in-game chat, or phone messaging should be kicked immediately.
* Anyone attempting to leave the STS should be kicked.
* Anyone who brings a vehicle into the area where you are lined up should be kicked.
{% endhint %}

* Now get in formation as seen below: (to be done)
* Visit [here - to be done](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FFEAkFpUPjEnShMPYf91T%2Fuploads%2F2dNJvKc2Rky1HPFjKvv4%2FSTS%20audio.m4a?alt=media\&token=38329b26-daac-4c68-9517-459e16d8e4c4) to download the file, then do m!play (attach file).
* After the Host has run these commands and the bot has begun to speak, start your assigned task:
  * VC checks: kick anyone who isn't in VC.
  * Avatar checks: note down the username of any player with a dodgy avatar so you can teleport to them the moment the bot stops speaking finishes.
  * Crowd control: observe all members and the spawn for players suddenly joining.
* Teleport new players to the line using:

```
:tp [Player] [Player]
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Notes

* You must stand in the position that corresponds with your role.
* If you see a staff member not following any of these rules, gather proof and make a Staff Report.
