# In-Game Moderation

This page describes three common forms of punishment: Warning, Kick, and Ban. It explains behaviors that may result in each punishment, and what they mean in different contexts. From minor offenses to major violations, this provides an overview of punishment levels and the reasons behind them.

{% hint style="info" %}
Every punishment must be logged. Provide full detail in your logs — do not use shorthand like "FRP" without explaining what happened (for example: "FRP - Swimming underwater for over 4 minutes."). Detailed logs help track why people are moderated and aid Internal Affairs when reviewing staff reports.
{% endhint %}

All moderations are handled using [Melonly](https://melonly.xyz).

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Create a moderation (Melonly)

1. Open the moderation panel in your browser (found in Staff Info).
2. Under "Create a new log", search the username.
3. When their profile appears, fill out the form — provide full detail for the reason.
4. Click Create.
5. Verify the user’s previous moderation history (displayed to the side).
   * If they have more than 10 points, issue a Ban BOLO.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

If you accidentally enter the incorrect reason, you may edit the moderation log within the Melonly panel, however if you accidentally used the wrong punishment type, or moderated the wrong user, you would need to contact a member of the Internal Affairs Team+ and explain what is wrong. Provide the punishment ID if available.



## Verbal Warnings

A verbal warning may be issued onto members if you feel that they did not mean to break a rule or completely understand their mistake and that they will not do it again.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Verbal warnings are issued based on discretion; however verbal warnings are not allowed to be issued to players who violate a rule which warrants a ban.
{% endhint %}

## Warnings

* A warning is the lowest punishment and must be logged via Melonly.
* Each warning is worth 1 moderation point.
* Two warnings are equal to a removal from the in-game server.

## Kick

* A kick is a temporary removal (the user is disconnected from the server) and is logged on their record via Melonly.
* Kicks are typically used for offences such as RDM.
* Each kick is worth 2 moderation points.
* Users may rejoin after a kick.

## Ban & Ban BOLOs

* A ban is a permanent removal from the server; banned users cannot join the server anymore.
* Bans are administered by Administrators and are for serious infractions (e.g., mass RDM).
* Bans must be logged via Melonly.
* A ban is worth 10 moderation points.

<details>

<summary>Ban BOLO (Be On the Lookout)</summary>

* Moderators can issue a Ban BOLO for users who need to be banned but cannot issue the ban themselves.
* Administrators should complete Ban BOLOs at their earliest convenience.
* While a Ban BOLO is outstanding, moderators may continue to kick the user in-game until an Administrator applies the ban.

## Moderation points and counting

Madison State Roleplay utilizes a 10-point system for all players, once a player reaches ten moderation points, they are to be banned. Down below are how many points a member is issued when they are moderated:

* Verbal Warnings: 0 points
* Warnings: 1 point each
* Kicks: 2 points each
* Ban: 10 points

If a person has been banned before, only count moderation points gained after the most recent ban. If a person's last moderation was a ban and there have been no moderations after that (and they are in-game), it means the ban was successfully appealed and they now have 0 moderation points.
