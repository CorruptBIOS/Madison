# Priority Scene Guide

## Priority Form

To prevent numerous priority scenes such as bank robberies from occurring, we have implemented a form for players to fill out who want to start a priority scene. You are to provide the player with the form link [here](https://melonly.xyz/forms/priority/7370393854744203264).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important:

* Please ensure that the player who is filling out the form is a whitelisted member, if they are not then do not send them the form link.
{% endhint %}

Read over the form that they filled out please check the form check for the following:

* How many players are involved
* Detailed setup on how the scene will go.
* Does not involve absurd fortifications such as the following:
  * Escape tunnels
  * Walls enforced with rebar (rebar on doors and windows are fine)
  * Bulletproof windows
  * Hidden/Obscure rooms
  * Silent alarms
  * Tripwires
  * Pressure plates
  * Every window and or entryway being barricaded (At least one must be unobscured)
  * Generators running inside the house (Considered suicide roleplay)

## Getting Started

If you believe that the priority form is good enough you may conduct the following tasks:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Notify players involved to prepare the scene

* Go into the VC that they are in and tell them to start setting up the scene.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Announcements & prepare staff to join STS VC

Once the scene is ready you may then alert law enforcement about the on-going scene by doing the following:

* Approve of the priority form and set the priority timer from either 900 to 1200 depending on how long you think the scene will go on for.
* Head into LEO RTO and use the "Hold All Traffic" soundboard, then explain to law enforcement while adhering to RTO rules what the nature of the scene is and where it is located at.
* Wait 10 seconds
* Then run the following command:

```
:m [NOTICE] A priority timer has been put into effect; whilst the timer is in effect, you are not permitted to start any other major roleplays such as shootouts, pursuits, robberies, etc.
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Scene Supervisory

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important:

* If the scene beings to or is immediately obvious to be unrealistic, you may call off the priority scene at any time.
{% endhint %}

Once law enforcement arrives, it is your job to ensure that the scene goes out uninterrupted. If someone who is not on law enforcement and has no permission of being on the scene, you would tell them to leave. If the player refuses or does nothing within 10 seconds you can load them.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
