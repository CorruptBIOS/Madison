# SSU & SSD Guide

#### Session Start Up

An SSU will be hosted between 2PM–3PM EST by a member of the Internal Affairs Team or above. Before the server goes up, the IA member hosting the SSU will ping @here to see who can get on their Main Staff Duties. If you are unable to get on your Main Staff Duties, or wish to join to roleplay, do NOT react to their message. If you’re unable to get in-game then please don’t react — requests to open the server from people who cannot join will be declined.

When the server has been opened by the IA member+, you must follow the On-Duty procedure (found in the "Policies" section of this website), and set a Peace timer for 10 minutes (600 seconds) by using the command:

{% code title="In-game command" %}
```
:pt 600
```
{% endcode %}

This ensures people ease into roleplays rather than immediately escalating into a shootout or pursuit.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If the server was opened without an IA member+ approving it, punishments will occur.
{% endhint %}

When you're in-game on Main Staff Duties, you must do the following:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Join the in-game server

Join the server you were asked to staff.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Set a peace timer

Run the peace timer command to give roleplayers a 10-minute cooldown.

{% code title="In-game command" %}
```
:pt 600
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Update your roleplay username

Enter the DMV and put "Madison State Staff" in your roleplay username.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Join the sheriff team

Select and join the sheriff team with the callsign \[MSS-XX] as required for Main Staff Duties.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Spawn a staff vehicle

Spawn a car with the staff livery for visibility and consistency.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Start your shift

Begin performing Staff Duties per policy.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Session Shutdown (SSD)

Before contacting a member of the Internal Affairs Team for an SSD, consider the following:

* Is the server below 10 members?
* Is there no realistic way to regain members?
* Are any quality roleplays being conducted?

If the answer to all three is no, you must ask an Internal Affairs member or above for permission to perform an SSD. Shutting down the server without permission will be treated as admin abuse.

Once permission has been granted, run the following announcements and commands in-game.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not shut down the server without IA permission — this is considered admin abuse.

Please use the exact in-game commands shown above when making announcements or setting timers.
{% endhint %}

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Pre-shutdown announcement

Post the following announcement to warn players the server is closing soon:

{% code title="In-game command (:m) - First announcement" %}
```
:m The server will be shutting down shortly. Please start finishing up your roleplays and prepare to leave the server within the next 3 minutes.
```
{% endcode %}

Wait around 2–3 minutes after this announcement.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Closing announcement

Post a thank-you/closing message:

{% code title="In-game command (:m) - Second announcement" %}
```
:m Thank you for joining this SSU, we appreciate your participation hope you see you again soon. Wishing you a good day or evening!
```
{% endcode %}

Wait around 30 seconds after this announcement.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Kick all players

{% hint style="success" %}
Server administrators are permitted to use the shutdown command to remove all players from the server.
{% endhint %}

Run the kick command to remove all players before shutdown:

{% code title="In-game command" %}
```
:kick all Server Shutting down.
```
{% endcode %}

After kicking everyone, announce in Staff Chat that the SSD is complete. Melonly automatically clocks staff off when the server shuts down.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
