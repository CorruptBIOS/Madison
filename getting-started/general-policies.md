# General Policies

Whilst representing Madison State Roleplay, we expect you to uphold and follow a high standard of professionalism and integrity. We expect our staff to be honest and truthful when carrying out their duties as a Staff Member. Respect is a must; you should be showing respect towards your peers and others within the Community. Dedication is needed — this ensures that our Staff Team is running efficiently as it can be. When carrying out your Moderation duties we expect you to be fair and just when giving out punishments. Taking accountability for your actions is key to success; if you have done something wrong then it is better to be honest and upfront with the Team. We expect all of our Staff to have a sense of teamwork and communication ethics to ensure that the team can run as efficiently as possible.

{% step %}
### Activities Outside of Madison

* Whilst you are a member of our staff team, you are expected to show respect anywhere you go.
* We do not moderate activities outside of MSRP unless we find it is having a direct impact on us.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Drama & Arguments

* Do not take part in or instigate any sort of arguments, drama, or issues between other Staff Members or community members — you should be defusing the situation instead of escalating it.
* If you have drama with someone you should take it to DMs and not bring it into Madison. If it is brought into Madison and you don’t drop it, consequences will be given by the IA Team.
* You may not take part in mass blocks to attempt to isolate and/or harass members of the community.

If you feel you need to discuss any issues or concerns with another member of the Staff team, the IA team are here to help you.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Staff Punishments

* If a staff member does anything that the Internal Affairs team deems unacceptable, they will be issued a punishment.
* The Internal Affairs team has complete discretion over the punishments, and the punishments vary from case to case.
* A staff member may receive only 3 strikes, after which they are terminated.
* A staff member may only receive 3 activity strikes, after which they are terminated.
  * Activity strikes reset every 6 months.
* All Staff punishments provided are confidential. You may not discuss them outside of IA. If you need to discuss it, open an IA ticket or DM a member of IA.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Activity Evaluations

* Every week the Internal Affairs Team will conduct Activity Evaluations to ensure that staff members are meeting their activity requirements. Every staff member must get at least 4 hours every week.
  * Evaluations will be conducted at the end of each week. This means that you must have your requirements done by this time.
* If you won’t be able to meet your requirements for that week then you should submit an LOA (see the LOA section for more information).
* If you’re not on LOA and don’t meet your requirements then you will be given a Strike by the Internal Affairs Team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Leave Of Absence (LOA)

We understand that sometimes people may not be able to meet their requirements, therefore they can submit an LOA. To do this open the moderate panel and utilize the LOA Manage function.

Before submitting one, please understand the following:

* LOA’s must end on a Sunday.
* LOA's must be requested on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays.
* LOA’s can’t be longer than 2 weeks (if it needs to be longer, speak with a member of Internal Affairs).
* Submit the LOA the same week you would like to be excused from evaluations.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Leaking

* Leaking is the act of sharing information to users that don’t have access to it. This includes telling them verbally about things within the Staff team, sending screenshots, videos, GIFs, etc., of staff-only areas and staff assets to people who are not part of the Staff Team currently. This includes sharing it to former staff members — unless they can see it themselves, you’re not permitted to show it to them or tell them about it.
* Anyone that is caught leaking will be instantly terminated from the staff team.
* If you think that someone is leaking or if you don’t know whether telling someone something is leaking, ask a Member of the Internal Affairs Team before doing so.
* All private IA interactions via officers & DMs are confidential to you and the IA team. You may not discuss any of this with anyone that is below the rank of IA or with any members. This includes all staff punishments — they are confidential.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Nickname Format

* As a staff member, you’re mandated to follow our Nickname format. When you’re on duty you should have your appropriate callsign in front of your name (nothing that shows your rank).
  * You should not put any sort of custom font within your name; this is not allowed.
* When not on-duty you should be following Rule 2 of the Discord Rules at all times, including having a call sign in your name when you’re not in-game or any other roleplay format.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Username Changes

* When you’re changing your Roblox Username as a staff member, you’re obliged to tell someone from the Internal Affairs Team so they can update data including evaluation sheets and punishments.
  * Failure to notify IA within 24 hours of changing your username will result in consequences from the Internal Affairs Team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Reporting Fellow Staff

* When you’re reporting a member of the Staff team you must open an Internal Affairs ticket.
  * You must not confront the staff member that you’re reporting or try to lecture them; this will cause drama, and you may also receive consequences.
* You must not notify the staff member or any other staff member that is not a part of the incident that you’re reporting them, to ensure no drama is caused.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Your Accounts

* You’re responsible for your own accounts. If any of your accounts become hacked or compromised, the Internal Affairs Team withholds the right to remove you from the Staff Team to ensure the safety of the server and the community.
* You are not permitted to give access to your account to others that are not a part of the Staff Team. If you’re caught doing so you will be removed.
  * You’re responsible for your own account; anything that happens on your account you will be held accountable for and consequences will be given to you, even if you weren't on the account.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Suggestions

* Staff members are expected to use the Staff Suggestions channel instead of the regular Suggestions channel. The regular Suggestions channel is for community members and is not to be used by staff.
{% endstep %}
