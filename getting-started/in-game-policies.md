# In-Game Policies

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Introduction

Whilst representing Madison State Roleplay, you are expected to uphold and follow a high standard of professionalism and integrity. Staff should be honest and truthful when carrying out their duties. Respect, dedication, fairness, accountability, teamwork, and clear communication are required to ensure the Staff Team runs efficiently.

If you break any of these expectations you may be subject to consequences from the Internal Affairs (IA) Team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Grammar

* When On Duty as a Staff Member at Madison State Roleplay, you must maintain a standard of grammar that portrays a professional staff member.
* Use correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar while on duty in-game. We understand not everyone is perfect, but these basics ensure clear and appropriate communication.

Failure to comply may result in consequences from the Internal Affairs Team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Professionalism

* While representing Madison State Roleplay, you must uphold professionalism that reflects positively on the server and Staff Team.
* Be considerate of your actions in and around Madison: do not break rules while roleplaying in-game, and do not break rules on other servers.
* Follow all professionalism expectations detailed in the Professionalism Guide.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use of Power

* As staff you are trusted with powers in-game and on Discord. Use these powers correctly when carrying out your duties.
* Do not use commands on staff or others unless authorised. The Internal Affairs Team logs all commands run in Discord and in-game; abuse will be detected and punished.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### On-Duty Policies

* When On-Duty in-game, follow required procedures:
  * Be in RTO listening for priorities.
  * If you go AFK, it must be no more than 10 minutes and you must notify peers in staff chat; otherwise leave the server and end your shift.
* All mod calls should be answered within 40 seconds of appearing on your screen. The call must be taken regardless of roleplay duty.
* Change your in-game roleplay name to “Madison State Staff” and have the appropriate Staff Callsign in your Discord nickname (refer to staff info).
* You must be clocked in at all times while in-game. Staff may not be in-game but not clocked in to avoid mod calls.
* When leaving the server give a minimum notice of 5 minutes in staff chat unless it’s an emergency. Ping staff online to replace you; if no-one replaces you, an admin can run the !staffneeded command.
  * There must be at least one person on active staff duty at ALL times. A 5-minute grace period is permitted during changeover.
* Failure to follow on-duty policies will result in consequences from the Internal Affairs Team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### On-Duty Limit

* To prevent staffing overload, a maximum of 6 active duty staff may be in-game at once (excludes IA+).
* If more than 6 people are on active staff duty, those who have already completed their requirements will be asked to roleplay. If no-one has completed requirements, those who clocked on earliest will be asked to end their shift.
* There should be a minimum of 1 Staff Member on duty at all times. It is better to SSD the server than leave it unmoderated.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Uniform Policy

* On-Duty staff must adhere to the Uniform Policy and maintain professionalism.
* You must wear the appropriate uniform at all times.
* Prohibited: unnatural hair colours, LEO-like accessories, large accessories that cover key uniform information or protrude excessively.
* If unsure about your avatar, have it checked by a member of the Internal Affairs Team before using it On-Duty.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Driving Policy

* When On-Duty you should patrol the map. You may monitor a scene, but not stay in one spot for more than 10 minutes (minute cheating).
* When patrolling in a staff vehicle, follow traffic laws at all times. Running red lights, speeding, driving in opposite lanes, driving over curbs/sidewalks, etc., will result in consequences.
* Driving should be seamless and unnoticed; ensure staff driving does not interfere with roleplayers (allow overtakes, pull over in congestion, etc.).
* Park vehicles appropriately: parking bays, side of the road with wheel behind the white line (not blocking over half the pavement), or on grass in a straight parallel line to the road.
* Patrolling on foot is not permitted.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Logging Punishments

* All in-game punishments must be logged to track user history and identify repeat offenders.
  * This includes Warnings, Kicks, Bans, and Ban Requests.
* The Internal Affairs Team can view all logged punishments and those you have issued. Issuing punishments without reason will result in consequences.
* In-game punishments are not issued outside of SSUs. If a rule was broken outside an active SSU (or in a previous SSU), do not moderate in-game.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Minute Cheating

* Minute cheating is clocking in and failing to carry out duties by being absent, AFK, or avoiding duties.
* Minute cheating is strictly prohibited and will result in consequences from the IA Team. If you will be AFK for more than 10 minutes, put your shift on break or end it.
* If you suspect someone of minute cheating, gather proof and report it to the Internal Affairs Team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Proactive Moderation

* While On-Duty, use downtime wisely. When there are no calls or reminders, review the member list and observe individuals for around 30 seconds each to watch for rule breakers.
* Proactive moderation helps catch rule breakers and remove problem players before issues escalate.
* Failure to proactively moderate will be classed as minute cheating and may lead to removal from the staff team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Reminders and Server Control

* Reminders:
  * Reminders must be completed by staff while on duty.
  * Two types: STS Reminders & VC/Vehicle Checks. Both are expected to be completed unless IA states otherwise.
  * Reminders are the responsibility of those on ODS. If call volume is high, those on roleplay duty should assist.
* Server Control:
  * Whether on roleplay duty or ODS, staff must collectively keep the server under control regarding priorities.
  * Use timers: priority timers and peace timers.
  * When an ongoing priority scene exists, a timer MUST be set so police can focus on the large scene.
  * If the server remains chaotic after the scene, issue a cooldown timer.
  * In severe cases, peacetimers can be used — ensure no priority scenes are occurring.
  * If the scene doesn’t require the full remaining timer, you may remove it early.
  * All messages and timer lengths can be found in staff information.
