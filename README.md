### Welcome

Welcome to the Madison State staff team! This Staff Hub is your go-to spot for everything you need to know about your role. Think of it as your main resource for operational commands, who to report to, our policies, and any other guidance you might need.

Here's the important part: this should always be your first stop before asking another staff member for help. We expect all our team members, especially senior staff, to know this handbook inside and out. So please take some time to really go through it. Use it as your main reference before reaching out to someone else.

The Staff Hub is organized into clear sections to help you find what you need quickly. It's your responsibility to stay up to date, so make sure to check back regularly for any updates or changes.

One quick tip: bookmark this site so you can easily come back to it whenever you need to. That way, you'll always have the information you need right at your fingertips.
