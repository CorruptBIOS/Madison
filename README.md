### Welcome

Hello and Welcome to the Madison State Staff Team. This hub will contain all the information you will need as a staff member, including topics such as commands, chain of command, and more. This should always be your first point of contact before asking another staff member. Our staff members (especially senior staff) are expected to know this handbook like the back of their hand, so please ensure you take the time to do so.

The Staff Hub is a website divided into clear sections for each topic, making it easy to find exactly what you need. It’s your responsibility to regularly check and stay up to date with any changes made to the hub. Our general advice would be to bookmark it so you can easily access it in the future.
